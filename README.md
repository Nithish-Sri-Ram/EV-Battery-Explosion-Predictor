This repository houses the EV Vehicle Explosion Predictor project, a triumphant solution that secured the Best IoT Project award in a hackathon. Developed to enhance the safety of electric vehicles (EVs), this project focuses on detecting temperature anomalies within an EV bike and sending timely warnings to the user's mobile app when the temperature exceeds the safe limit. This innovative approach aims to prevent potential accidents resulting from vehicle explosions.

## Project Components

1. Node MCU: The project utilizes Node MCU, a low-cost open-source IoT platform, to facilitate communication between the EV bike and the mobile app.

2. Temperature and Pressure Sensor: DHT11 and BMP180 is integrated into the EV bike to continuously monitor temperature levels. In the event of an anomaly, the system responds accordingly.

3. MIT App Inventor: The mobile app is developed using MIT App Inventor, providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for receiving real-time warnings and ensuring prompt user response.

## How It Works

The EV Vehicle Explosion Predictor operates as follows:

â†’The temperature and pressure sensor on the EV bike constantly monitors the environmental conditions.

â†’If the temperature exceeds the predefined safe limit, the Node MCU triggers a warning message.

â†’The warning message is transmitted to the user's mobile app via the MIT App Inventor-developed application.

â†’The user receives the warning message, enabling them to take immediate action and prevent potential accidents.
